# About RecallCode

RecallCode is a coding practice platform designed to help developers and students strengthen their programming knowledge through daily learning, selective questions, and challenging problem sets.

In a world where technology evolves faster than ever, developers often struggle to retain what they’ve already learned. RecallCode was built with a simple mission — to make coding recall easy, effective, and consistent.

We believe that learning to code isn’t just about completing tutorials or watching videos — it’s about active recall and repetition, which are scientifically proven to improve long-term memory and understanding.

Our platform lets users:
- Practice coding concepts daily with bite-sized exercises.
- Focus on *selective questions* to target weak areas.
- Take *challenge rounds* to test logical thinking and time-based problem-solving.
- Track progress and stay motivated through consistent practice.

Whether you’re a beginner trying to grasp programming basics or an experienced developer aiming to keep your skills sharp, RecallCode helps you grow every day.

Our goal is to make RecallCode a place where learning feels rewarding — not overwhelming. We’re continuously improving by adding new languages, smarter question recommendations, and more interactive ways to keep your coding brain active.

**Stay consistent, stay sharp — with RecallCode.**
